Implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm on a complex graph problem.

## Problem : Given an undirected weighted graph representing time required to travel from one city to another using flight and bus service. The user is allowed to book only 1 flight path at most and unlimited bus paths. Find the shortest time consuming path for the user to travel from one city to another.
